# numbers-game
A fun and challenging number-based game designed to test your math skills and sharpen your brain. Built with Python, perfect for anyone who loves numbers and logic puzzles.

## Game Concept
The Fibonacci Challenge is designed to sharpen math skills and pattern recognition by presenting players with puzzles based on the Fibonacci sequence. Here are three possible challenge modes:

### Next Number Challenge:
The game shows a partial Fibonacci sequence and asks the player to calculate and enter the next number.

### Missing Number Challenge:
A sequence is displayed with one number hidden (represented by a blank), and the player must determine the missing Fibonacci number.

### Custom Fibonacci Challenge:
Instead of starting with the usual 0 and 1, the game randomly selects two starting numbers and generates a Fibonacci-like sequence. The player is then asked to compute a later term in the sequence.

Each round is timed or scored to add extra excitement and progressively increases in difficulty.
